### Metamath

For the Metamath specification, see chapter 4 and appendix C of [the Metamath book][1]. A discussion on the theory behind Metamath can be found on section 1.4 of the book. The paper [Models for Metamath][2] is also of interest.

The verifiers found in this repository are based on [`mmverify.py`][3] by Raph Levien. Other verifiers can be found in the [Metamath website][4].
